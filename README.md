# Power factor improvement in long transmission line using rigorous method
Electrical systems require consistent voltage levels and efficient power utilization to function reliably. Two key techniques ensure these goals: automatic voltage regulation (AVR) and power factor correction (PFC). Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR): A Steady Hand on the Power Grid Imagine the power grid as a vast network of pipes delivering electricity. Ideally, the pressure (voltage) should remain constant regardless of how much water (current) is flowing through the pipes (circuits). Automatic voltage regulation acts like a pressure regulator, automatically adjusting the voltage output based on real-time needs. This ensures that appliances and equipment receive the correct voltage for proper operation, even when power demands fluctuate.
